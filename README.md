# domeshow-PICL

Firmware for domeshow/lightshow boards (2017) using a [PIC24FJ32GA102](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/39951C.pdf) microcontroller.

## Getting Started

How to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* [MPLABÂ® X IDE v4.01](http://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide) - See the Downloads section.

### Project Setup

Clone the domeshow-PICL repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/teslaworksumn/domeshow-PICL.git
```

Start MPLAB. Go to File > Open Project and navigate to the domeshow-PICL directory. Select the DomeShow.X project and click Open Project to open it.

Confirm that the project is configured for the correct device by going to Production > Set Project Configuration > Customize. From here, make sure that the text in the Device field is **PIC24FJ32GA102**
